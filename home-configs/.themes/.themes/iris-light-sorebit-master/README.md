==========

A more adult version of xyl0n's Iris-light Gtk theme.

The window decoration themes do not currently work, with the exception of the Metacity theme.

Alsa I am aware of a checbox hover bug and will fix it.

Checkboxes and radios have been merged from [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).

Also see [Iris Dark](https://github.com/xyl0n/iris) and [Original Iris Light](https://github.com/xyl0n/iris-light).

==========
Installation Instructions:

Extract the zip file to the themes directory i.e. "/usr/share/themes/"
Alternatively, extract it to the ".themes" directory in your home folder if you want the theme to be applied only to you user.

Use a theme changer such as Gnome Tweak Tool, Ubuntu Tweak or LXappearance to change the the theme to Iris Light
