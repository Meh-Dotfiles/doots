# Arc-Undead recolor
#### A simplified GTK Arc Theme

Disclaimer: Credit for most of this goes to [the original Arc Theme.](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) Credit for the initial stripping of the arc theme and vector rework goes to [Arc Undead.](https://github.com/chrisduerr/arc-undead) All this adds is an easier recolor option and stripping of some unused assets/files.

### Installation
All you need to do to install this theme in its base configuration is running `install.sh` as root (or any other user that has access to `/usr/share/themes`) and the theme is ready to use. Note that it's smart to already configure it to your liking before running this as configuration is parsed at install.

### Config
This theme aims to be as easy to recolor as possible, and this can be done in a few steps. An example recolor (mine) is set in conf by default.

- set colors and theme name in conf file
- install as explained before

### Final Notice
Keep in mind I stripped this while only testing on my own system(minimal twm), the lack of some files could cause trouble with some DEs, I simply have no idea. Colors might also not be set entirely as intended, but should be good enough.
