Fairly self explanitory

backup-original-files.sh should be used before any other scripts. It will backup all of the original files to a folder in the same structure for easy full restore at any time

backup.sh will back up whatever is listed to the external variable set at the start of the script, simply change  external="/where/your/chosen/drive/is/mounted"
                                            #######  these two must have used the same drive (duh) it cant restore what was never created #######
restore.sh will put the files backed up to the external variable set at the start of the script, simply change   external="/where/your/backup/drive/is/mounted"

The two install scripts install software listed one is from arch user repository and requires yaourt. the other updates the os, syncs the database and installs base packages

My personal favorite is the full-all-in-one.sh   This will do all of the above as well as sync the database and update the os
